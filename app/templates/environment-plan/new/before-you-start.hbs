    <h3>Do I need to submit an Environment Plan?</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone who wants to undertake a petroleum or greenhouse gas activity is required to submit an environment plan
      (EP) and have it accepted by NOPSEMA before they may undertake that activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submission of an EP to NOPSEMA is an eligible voluntary action for the purposes of Part 9.6A of the Offshore
      Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. Titleholder(s) submitting an EP remain responsible for compliance
      with the requirements of Part 9.6A in all cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      An EP submission may be made to NOPSEMA by completion of this form. If you have any difficulties in using this
      form, please contact xxx.
